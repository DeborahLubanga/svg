###Drawing on the Web Assignment 4

For this assignment I created an interactive timeline about the carving of the Stone Mountain Memorial in Georgia, which is the focus of my journalism honors thesis.

Three carvers worked on the monument over the course of 60 years:  

- Borglum Gutzon (1915-1924)
- Augustus Lukeman (1925-1928)
- Walter Hancock (1963-1972)

I used Adobe Illustrator to create my SVG image, but I edited the ids and classes in my HTML file to make them more meaningful.
